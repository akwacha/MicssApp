He suggested ... that 30 minutes of a new language ... should be enough to start to make one-self understood ... and then ... the best way ... to progress ... was to speak ... confidently ... more and more ... with natural speakers of the language.  So on we go ... for one whole day ... with a partner or small group ... speaking and speaking ... and moving ... face, hands and body language to reinforce your communication ... and ending with ... almost instinctive ... easy inter-active conversation ... in the natural language ... and if you are lucky enough to find ...

This is a simple IRT exercise, to give you confidence to learn naturally. When you don\\'t believe you can learn ... you won\\'t learn! ... When you are tense, anxious and stressed ... you won\\'t learn!  When you have no confidence ... you won\\'t learn. But with relaxation, your mind and body become clear, confident and ready to learn.  So do the IRT exercise now ... and again before every CRE session.  It takes only three minutes, and with practice, it becomes a powerful tool for you. The only \"equipment\" you need is an \"open mind\" and a marble (or similar small object) in your \"right\" (major) hand. 2.  So, get into that comfortable position, in which you know ... you really can relax. Be aware that marble gets warm as it absorbs heat from contact with your right hand. Open you hand and allow the warmth to evaporate. Close the hand again, and recognize the marble ... as a physical external symbol ... of the internal function of your mind and body. Allow it to receive and evaporate not just heat ... but emotion, anxiety and stress ... leaving you free, relaxed, confident and ready to learn to speak and understand the natural language without effort ....    3.  Now, relax with the hands on the lap, and fix your eyes on the marble as you repeat aloud ... the following sentence ... four times, feeling free to change the wording a little ... to fit your style ... four times ... aloud ... in all: \"I AM, I CAN, I WILL, I BELIEVE  ... I  WILL LEARN ... AND HELP OTHERS TO LEARN ... TO SPEAK AND ENJOY ... THE NEW NATURAL LANGUAGE  ... WITH A BEAUTIFUL ACCENT ... NATURALLY ... RAPIDLY ... EASILY ... WITHOUT EFFORT\" 4. With the eyes fixed on the marble ... or closed if you wish ...  start to take three slow and very deep breaths ... and be sure to pause ... on each inhalation ... and imagine ... each exhalation ... as transferring all the anxiety and stress ... from your mind and body ... through to the marble in your hand. 5. After the third breath, let your whole mind and body relax completely for two minutes ... thinking ONLY of your breathing ... nothing else ... no self talk at all ... just concentrate on the BREATHING ... very important, counting down from 20 to 1.  6. Then bring yourself back, by simply counting up from 1 to 5, feeling well, relaxed, confident and ready to learn. The marble is now your very personal symbol ... of your confidence to learn and speak the natural language with a beautiful accent.  Note: This simple CRE \"Instant Relaxation Technique\" can be used anywhere (eyes open or closed) to achieve a calm mind ... without anger, anxiety or stress ... ready and confident to learn .. or deal with any new problem ... that you have to face.  Keep the marble always to hand, as a symbol ... of your confidence ... to feel comfortable ... in the new natural language ... and to speak almost instinctively ... without stress or effort ...  ! 4', metadata={'source': 'SourceData/chichewa.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='SIMPLE THROAT EXERCISE - 16 KEY WORDS (Repeat EACH CHICHEWA word many times slowly ... and then at VERY high speed) Thank youZikomoHelloMoniMr.A-BamboMrs.A-MayiYesIndeNoIyayGoodBwino?PleaseChondeDo you have?Kodi mu li ndi...?GoodbyeTsalani bwinoSee you soon!Ndikuwona posachedwaWho?Ndani?! 5', metadata={'source': 'SourceData/chichewa.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='Note:  For simplicity ... the program is mostly typed without accents!

Do the Throat exercise - 16 key words     Play the tape when available or make your own (30 minutes) with the text (hear,      see, speak, MOVE, and feel) ... make it fun!  Review the Glossary (2 pages).        2 – Repeat the text (Sections 2-4) to understand every word!      Play the tape with the text SPEAKING VERY LOUDLY - STOP THE TAPE         AND SING OR SHOUT ANY VERY DIFFICULT PHRASES.

Play the tape WITHOUT the text, SPEAKING IN VERY DRAMATIC style.           Repeat the Throat exercise.      Begin to create simple conversation with the Mini-phrase book (Hello etc.). 4 – Repeat the text (Sections 11-16) to understand every word!      Play the tape with the text, SPEAKING SOFTLY with a good accent.           Do SPEED READING (Sections 2-16) and Mini-phrase Book.         5 – Play the tape WITHOUT the text, speaking with three different voices - just for fun!

REINFORCE the learning in the CAR/TRUCK at any time … make it an amusing THEATRE of one … YOU!!! … by playing and acting out …  ONLY Sections 2 - 16.   DO NOT play the relaxation sections in the car ... skip them please! Play the Learning Reinforcement side of the tape as needed for encouragement, be sure to blame your strategy, and not yourself!! 2.  RECOGNIZE that a TERRIBLE accent is PAINFUL … for the hearer … and so strive always for a beautiful accent in EVERY WORD. 3.

If they reply to you in ENGLISH … then YOU just CONTINUE to speak in the NATURAL new language … and they will too  ... 4.  LISTEN very carefully to what PEOPLE say to YOU … and BEFORE replying … REPEAT in YOUR MIND ... EXACTLY what they said … this gives you excellent PRACTICE in recognising good STRUCTURE. 5. HESITATE before you SPEAK … and then speak FREELY and CONFIDENTLY …  without long pauses and … WITHOUT … \"Urrs and Umms\" which are so ANNOYING and BORING … for the listener ... 6.  When you do not know a necessary word … do NOT hesitate … simply USE the ENGLISH word … in the sentence … the hearer will almost certainly give you the translation … and you can repeat it … three times to get it right … without embarrassment. Use the LEARNING REINFORCEMENT as needed but not in the car! 7.  Use SIMPLE SHORT sentences and be CONFIDENT as you begin to talk to people ... expect SUCCESS ... and you will NOT be disappointed ... and try just one MORE new thing ...  just for fun in  this one week ... drink one litre of WATER EVERY DAY … it rinses mind and body and has a REMARKABLE preventive/curative therapeutic effect … to support new learning ... on we go together. \\n! 9', metadata={'source': 'SourceData/chichewa.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='1.

      "[Document(page_content='MALAWI \\n  \\n \\nAN INTRODUCTION TO THE CHICHEWA LANGUAGE  \\n Chichewa language is spoken in almost all parts of Malawi. There are several \\nother languages and dialects spoken in different regions for instance, \\nChitumbuka, Chiyao, Chilomwe, Chitonga,  Chisena, Chilambia and Chinkhonde.  \\nIt should be emphasized here that the basic grammatical structure is almost the \\nsame for all the languages. The difference is in terms of vocabulary, intonations \\nand pronunciation.  As for the Chichewa alphabet, some letters do not exist i.e. \\n“Q” and “ X”. The letter  “C” always carries an “H”.

You will notice definite patterns as you watch the verb change from  \\nactive to passive, intransitive to transitive, concrete to possible, verb to noun, verb to ideophone, etc.  I'm  \\nsure you will also notice that there is quite a bit of irregularity in how the variation actually affects the  \\nmeaning of the word; each word really must be learned on its own.  \\nNote that some of the root verbs themselves are no longer in use or are very rare.   An asterisk (*) after a  \\nword shows that that form is not very common.\\nBefore every verb stem, I put the prefix “ku – ” which makes it infinitive or gerund (to walk or walking) so  \\nthat you
